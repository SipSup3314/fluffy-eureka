      <p>
        I am a rather simple man who enjoys coding websites and doing other tech
        related stuff. My hobbies are playing video games, tinkering with
        computers, and touching grass. Here is my <a rel="me" target="_blank" href="https://cyberplace.social/@SipSup3314">Mastodon</a> profile and my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SipSup3314/">GitHub</a> account :)

            <h4>Shadow's Games</h4>
            <p>
              I made this website just so that I can play games in school. Works
              pretty well and is very low maintenance.

              This website was made to describe me, my interests, and my
              projects. I plan to use it in my adult life as a resume.
